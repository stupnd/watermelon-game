Build a complete, playable browser “Watermelon / Suika” game using this stack:

- Vite (vanilla)
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Matter.js for physics

Requirements (must-haves):
1) Project setup
- Assume I will run:
  mkdir watermelon-game && cd watermelon-game
  npm create vite@latest . -- --template vanilla
  npm install
- Tell me exactly what additional npm packages to install (Matter.js, etc.)

2) Files
Create and provide the full code for:
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js

3) UI
- A clean centered game container
- Canvas for gameplay
- Top bar showing Score
- Buttons: Restart, Pause/Resume
- A “danger line” drawn near the top of the bin

4) Gameplay
- Bin boundaries (floor + left/right walls) using static bodies
- A “current fruit preview” at the top that follows mouse X (clamped inside walls)
- Click OR Space drops the fruit
- Fruits are circles with levels 0..N with increasing radius and different labels/colors
- Random next fruit among the smallest few levels (like Suika style)

5) Merging rules
- When two fruits of the same level collide, merge:
  - Remove both bodies
  - Spawn one fruit of next level at collision position
  - Increase score (score based on new fruit level)
- Prevent double-merge bugs (e.g., mark bodies as “merging” and debounce)

6) Game over
- If any fruit’s top crosses the danger line continuously for ~1 second -> Game Over overlay
- Stop physics on Game Over
- Restart resets everything

7) Quality constraints
- Code must run without errors immediately after I paste the files and run `npm run dev`
- Keep code well-structured (small helper functions), but still all inside main.js
- No external assets required (use simple render: circles + text labels)
- Include comments only where needed (not a tutorial), but make the code readable

Output format:
- First: commands to install dependencies (npm)
- Then: provide code for index.html, style.css, main.js in separate code blocks
- Finally: a short “How to run” section (npm run dev) and controls list (mouse/space/buttons).
